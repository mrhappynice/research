# Latest Breakthroughs in High-Temperature Superconductivity (Near Room Temperature)

## Introduction  
High-temperature superconductivity – where materials conduct electricity with zero resistance at unusually high temperatures – remains a “holy grail” of modern physics ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Yet%20assembling%20the%20right%20mix,of%20physics%20and%20materials%20science)). In conventional superconductors, this phenomenon occurs only at cryogenic temperatures. Achieving superconductivity at or near room temperature (~293 K) **and** at ambient pressure could revolutionize technology, enabling lossless power transmission, ultra-efficient electronics, and novel transportation systems ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Room%20temperature%20superconductivity%20could%20introduce,to%20run%20datacenters%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). Over the past five years, researchers have made notable strides toward this goal, discovering new superconducting materials and techniques. Many claims have emerged in this competitive quest; some have proven promising, while others turned out to be irreproducible or mistaken ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Yet%20assembling%20the%20right%20mix,of%20physics%20and%20materials%20science)) ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=2023%2C%20for%20example%2C%20a%20team,doped%20lutetium%20hydride%20material.l)). Below, we summarize the most significant recent developments – including novel materials (some approaching room-temperature operation), experimental breakthroughs, theoretical insights, and the outlook for practical applications.

## Novel High-T<sub>c</sub> Materials Approaching Room Temperature  

**Hydrogen-Rich Superconductors (Hydrides):** A major breakthrough has been the discovery of **hydrogen-based compounds** that superconduct at unprecedented temperatures under extreme pressure. In 2015, hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>3</sub>S) set a milestone with a T<sub>c</sub> of 203 K (–70 °C) at ~155 GPa ([Physics - Muted Response to New Claim of a Room-Temperature Superconductor](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.16.39#:~:text=Dias%E2%80%99%20material%20belongs%20to%20a,10%20times%20lower%20than%20that)). Building on this, in 2019 lanthanum decahydride (LaH<sub>10</sub>) was found to superconduct around *250 K* (–23 °C) under ~170 GPa of pressure ([Physics - Muted Response to New Claim of a Room-Temperature Superconductor](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.16.39#:~:text=Dias%E2%80%99%20material%20belongs%20to%20a,10%20times%20lower%20than%20that)) – breaching the halfway mark to room temperature. These **superhydrides** leverage hydrogen’s light atoms to achieve very high vibrational frequencies, which strengthen the electron-phonon “glue” in conventional BCS superconductivity. In 2020, an even more dramatic claim by Dias *et al.* reported carbonaceous sulfur hydride superconducting at *287 K* (~14 °C) under 267 GPa ([Physics - Muted Response to New Claim of a Room-Temperature Superconductor](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.16.39#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20Dias%E2%80%99%20team%20announced,result%2C%20making%20superconducting%20carbonaceous%20sulfur)). And in 2023, the same group announced **nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride** (LuH<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>) with a critical temperature of *294 K* (~21 °C), essentially room temperature, at a much lower pressure of 1 GPa ([Physics - Muted Response to New Claim of a Room-Temperature Superconductor](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.16.39#:~:text=including%20a%20sulfur%20hydride%20that,10%20times%20lower%20than%20that)). These results suggest room-temperature superconductivity is physically achievable in hydrogen-rich materials – *if* extreme pressures are applied.

However, it’s important to note reproducibility issues. The 2020 carbon–sulfur hydride result was **retracted** after other scientists identified anomalies in the data ([Physics - Muted Response to New Claim of a Room-Temperature Superconductor](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.16.39#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20Dias%E2%80%99%20team%20announced,result%2C%20making%20superconducting%20carbonaceous%20sulfur)). Similarly, the 2023 lutetium hydride claim – while initially lauded as a step toward ambient-pressure superconductors – faced skepticism and was later retracted by *Nature* amid concerns over data integrity ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=2023%2C%20for%20example%2C%20a%20team,doped%20lutetium%20hydride%20material.l)). To date, none of these near-room-temperature hydride superconductors have been independently reproduced outside the original team. In contrast, the 203 K H<sub>3</sub>S and ~250 K LaH<sub>10</sub> findings have been **robustly confirmed** by multiple groups and are accepted as record high T<sub>c</sub> values (albeit at very high pressures) ([Physics - Muted Response to New Claim of a Room-Temperature Superconductor](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.16.39#:~:text=Dias%E2%80%99%20material%20belongs%20to%20a,10%20times%20lower%20than%20that)). The hydrides demonstrate that **conventional superconductivity** (driven by phonons) can survive to astonishing temperatures when light elements like hydrogen are highly compressed – validating longstanding theoretical predictions that metallic hydrogen or hydrogen-rich alloys could be high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductors ([Physics - Muted Response to New Claim of a Room-Temperature Superconductor](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.16.39#:~:text=Dias%E2%80%99%20material%20belongs%20to%20a,10%20times%20lower%20than%20that)). The challenge ahead is finding *compositions or conditions that maintain these superconducting phases at far lower pressures*, inching closer to practical, ambient-pressure operation.

**Nickelate Superconductors:** Until recently, copper-oxide ceramics (“cuprates”) were the only materials to superconduct above liquid-nitrogen temperature (77 K) at ambient pressure. In the last five years, a **new class of superconducting oxides** based on nickel has emerged, offering a fresh avenue in high-T<sub>c</sub> research. In 2019, researchers at SLAC/Stanford discovered superconductivity in a thin film of **neodymium nickelate (Nd<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>NiO<sub>2</sub>)**, an “infinite-layer” nickel oxide structurally similar to cuprates ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=About%20five%20years%20ago%2C%20a,at%20temperatures%20comparable%20to%20cuprates)). This nickelate superconductor requires stringent synthesis conditions and showed a modest T<sub>c</sub> ~9–15 K, but it opened the door to exploring cuprate-analogous physics in nickel-based compounds. Remarkably, in 2023 a bulk **bilayer nickelate** (La<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) under pressure exhibited superconductivity with a critical temperature of **around 80 K** ([Signatures of superconductivity near 80 K in a nickelate under high pressure - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37437603/#:~:text=Although%20high,Formula%3A%20see%20text%5D%20and)). This places its T<sub>c</sub> on par with some cuprates, making it one of the highest-temperature superconductors outside the copper-oxide family. The catch: much like the hydrides, the bilayer nickelate required high pressure (on the order of 14–43 GPa) to attain the superconducting phase ([Signatures of superconductivity near 80 K in a nickelate under high pressure - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37437603/#:~:text=Although%20high,Formula%3A%20see%20text%5D%20and)). Still, these nickelates are an exciting new platform to test theories of unconventional superconductivity. They involve a different transition metal (Ni instead of Cu) and could help reveal which ingredients are truly essential for high-T<sub>c</sub> pairing in oxides.

Researchers have been quick to seek ways to stabilize nickelate superconductors **at ambient pressure**. A major advance came in 2024, when a Stanford/SLAC team demonstrated that thin films of a nickelate can be grown on a substrate that imposes lateral strain, effectively “squeezing” the nickelate and stabilizing its superconducting state **without external pressure** ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=However%2C%20these%20materials%20require%20extreme,study%20and%20practical%20applications%20challenging)) ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Stanford%20and%20SLAC,structure%20to%20adjust%20during%20growth)). They grew LaNiO<sub>3</sub>-derived thin films on a substrate (SrLaAlO<sub>4</sub>) which applies in-plane **compressive strain**, compensating for the absence of high external pressure. The strained films showed clear signs of superconductivity at low temperatures (onset around 26–42 K, depending on strain) ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=A%20new%20class%20of%20high,world%20applications)). Although due to defects they achieved zero resistance only at ~2 K ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=A%20new%20class%20of%20high,world%20applications)), this proof-of-concept is important. It means metastable high-T<sub>c</sub> phases (once accessible only in a diamond anvil cell) can be *chemically or mechanically stabilized* at normal pressure. Researchers are now optimizing compositions and strain levels to raise the transition temperature in nickelates ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=The%20researchers%20observed%20that%20the,promising%20path%20for%20further%20optimization)). The nickelate story underscores a general theme: **materials that superconduct at high T<sub>c</sub> often sit at the edge of stability**, and clever engineering (pressure, strain, etc.) is key to coaxing them into the superconducting state.

This strain mimics the effect of high pressure by squeezing the lattice, enabling superconductivity at ambient pressure. *Right:* Resistivity vs. temperature for different strain levels (ε) shows the material’s superconducting transition shifting to higher temperatures under greater compression ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=Image%3A%20Researchers%20stabilize%20a%20promising,3)) ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=The%20researchers%20observed%20that%20the,promising%20path%20for%20further%20optimization)).

**Other Notable Systems:** In addition to hydrides and nickelates, researchers have explored other unconventional routes to high-T<sub>c</sub>. One intriguing claim in early 2024 involved **defect-engineered graphite**. A European-South American team reported that by using the “Scotch tape” method (mechanical exfoliation) on pyrolytic graphite and introducing surface wrinkles (line defects), they observed signatures of superconductivity at *room temperature and ambient pressure* ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=The%20issue%20is%20once%20again,a)). In this scenario, the graphite’s line defects were hypothesized to facilitate Cooper pairing in certain one-dimensional pathways. The authors described it as the first *unambiguous* observation of zero resistance at 300 K in a bulk material at ambient pressure ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=The%20team%20conducting%20research%20into,resistance%20state)). If valid, this result is groundbreaking – offering a completely different approach (through nanoscale defect engineering rather than extreme pressure or exotic chemistry) to achieve high-T<sub>c</sub>. Many in the community remain cautious, however, since extraordinary claims require thorough verification. As of now, the graphite-based room-temperature superconductivity has not been independently confirmed, but it highlights the creative experimental directions being pursued.

Meanwhile, the highest confirmed T<sub>c</sub> at ambient pressure remains with the well-established **cuprates**. Mercury-based cuprates hold the record around 135 K (–138 °C) at 1 atm, and slightly higher (up to ~164 K) under modest pressure in lab settings. These copper-oxides (discovered in the 1980s) are still the basis for most **practical high-T<sub>c</sub> applications** (since they work with liquid-nitrogen cooling), even as new materials like hydrides surpass them in temperature (under impractical conditions). The last five years haven’t seen a leap in cuprate T<sub>c</sub>, but they have seen incremental progress in understanding and nano-engineering cuprates (discussed more below). Researchers also continue to investigate **iron-based superconductors** and **organic superconductors**, though their T<sub>c</sub> (up to ~55 K for iron pnictides, ~38 K for certain fullerides) have not dramatically improved recently, and they remain well below cryogenic milestones. In summary, *hydrogen-rich compounds* currently lead the race toward room-temperature superconductivity (in terms of raw T<sub>c</sub> achieved), while *nickelates and other novel oxides* open important new fronts, and *defect or interface engineering* offers unorthodox possibilities. Each of these developments is paired with innovative experimental methods enabling the breakthroughs.

## Experimental Techniques Fueling Breakthroughs  

Achieving high-T<sub>c</sub> often demands pushing materials beyond their usual conditions. Several cutting-edge **experimental techniques** have been critical in recent breakthroughs:

- **Extreme High-Pressure Synthesis:** Nearly all the record-shattering superconductors (like H<sub>3</sub>S and LaH<sub>10</sub>) were created in **diamond anvil cells**, which can squeeze samples to hundreds of gigapascals. In these tiny devices, researchers combine elements (for example, metal foils plus hydrogen gas) and often use lasers to heat them, forming novel superhydride compounds. High-pressure cells enabled the synthesis of LaH<sub>10</sub> and other hydrogen-rich superconductors that do not exist at ambient conditions ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=last%20summer%2C%20another%20group%20of,at%20temperatures%20comparable%20to%20cuprates)). The trade-off is that such extreme pressures make experiments very challenging – the sample volumes are tiny, and many standard measurement probes (like certain spectroscopies or large transport leads) can’t be easily used. Nonetheless, improved high-pressure techniques (including *in situ* electrical leads and magnetic sensors integrated into anvil cells) now allow researchers to detect zero resistance and Meissner effect in these microscopic samples. **Diamond anvil technology** has been steadily refined, giving scientists the ability to routinely explore new materials at pressures equivalent to the Earth’s core. Without it, the current record high-T<sub>c</sub> materials would simply not exist ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=However%2C%20these%20materials%20require%20extreme,study%20and%20practical%20applications%20challenging)). A key focus now is to use chemical substitutions (e.g. adding nitrogen or carbon to hydrides) to achieve comparable superconductivity at **lower** pressures – as attempted with the Lu-N-H system ([Physics - Muted Response to New Claim of a Room-Temperature Superconductor](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.16.39#:~:text=predicts%20should%20superconduct,10%20times%20lower%20than%20that)). Even though some of those attempts have been controversial, the general strategy of “chemical pre-compression” is promising: by tweaking composition, researchers aim to stabilize high-T<sub>c</sub> phases at pressures that are easier to attain and eventually at ambient pressure.

- **Thin-Film Epitaxy and Strain Engineering:** When external pressure isn’t practical, researchers can sometimes simulate its effect by growing crystals as thin films on substrates with mismatched lattice constants. This introduces **strain** in the film, tuning interatomic distances. The Stanford/SLAC work on nickelates is a prime example: they grew superconducting nickelate films on a substrate that exerted lateral compressive strain, *replacing the need for a 10+ GPa pressure cell* ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Stanford%20and%20SLAC,structure%20to%20adjust%20during%20growth)). By carefully controlling film growth conditions (using techniques like molecular beam epitaxy or pulsed laser deposition) and choosing substrates, one can impose either compressive or tensile stress and stabilize phases that don’t appear in bulk crystals. This approach was critical to demonstrate nickelate superconductivity at ambient pressure ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Stanford%20and%20SLAC,structure%20to%20adjust%20during%20growth)). More broadly, strain engineering is becoming a common tool to manipulate quantum materials: applying strain can enhance superconducting transition temperatures or induce superconductivity in borderline materials. It’s a powerful complement to chemical doping. The ability to strain a material *in situ* also allows the use of advanced characterization methods (e.g. X-ray scattering or ARPES on thin films) to probe the superconducting state ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=Studying%20superconductors%20under%20high%20pressure,material%27s%20properties%20in%20greater%20detail)), which is often impossible inside a thick-walled pressure cell. We will likely see more “strain-tuned” high-T<sub>c</sub> experiments, aiming to optimize known superconductors or discover new ones by design.

- **Twistronics and Interface Engineering:** Inspired by discoveries in two-dimensional materials, scientists have begun to **twist and stack** known superconductors to create new effects. In 2018, the “magic-angle” twisted bilayer graphene famously showed superconductivity (albeit at ~1 K), introducing the concept of *twistronics*. Recently, this idea was extended to high-T<sub>c</sub> materials. In 2023, an international team (Rutgers/Harvard and others) took two flakes of the cuprate **BSCCO** (a bismuth-based cuprate that superconducts below ~90 K) and rotated one layer 45° relative to the other ([Researchers Craft New Way to Make High-Temperature Superconductors – With a Twist | Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/news/researchers-craft-new-way-make-high-temperature-superconductors-twist#:~:text=The%20experimentalists%20first%20split%20an,superconductivity%20at%20the%20fragile%20interface)). Astonishingly, the twisted double-layer remained superconducting and even exhibited a **novel “magnetic” superconducting state** not seen in the untwisted material ([Researchers Craft New Way to Make High-Temperature Superconductors – With a Twist | Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/news/researchers-craft-new-way-make-high-temperature-superconductors-twist#:~:text=To%20Pixley%2C%20the%20study%20enlarges,yields%20other%20insights%2C%20as%20well)) ([Researchers Craft New Way to Make High-Temperature Superconductors – With a Twist | Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/news/researchers-craft-new-way-make-high-temperature-superconductors-twist#:~:text=team%20at%20Harvard%20University%20led,professor%20and%20physicist%20Philip%20Kim)). The twist created a moiré pattern that altered the pairing symmetry, giving rise to what the researchers suggest could be a **superconducting diode** behavior (allowing current to flow preferentially in one direction) ([Researchers Craft New Way to Make High-Temperature Superconductors – With a Twist | Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/news/researchers-craft-new-way-make-high-temperature-superconductors-twist#:~:text=team%20at%20Harvard%20University%20led,professor%20and%20physicist%20Philip%20Kim)). This is a striking example of how *structural manipulation at the nanoscale* can produce new superconducting phases. Likewise, creating artificial interfaces between different materials can induce superconductivity – e.g. monolayer FeSe on a SrTiO<sub>3</sub> substrate exhibited enhanced T<sub>c</sub> (~60–70 K) due to interfacial effects (an observation just outside the five-year window but influential in ongoing research). These experimental techniques underscore that we are no longer limited to studying naturally occurring crystals – we can build multi-layer heterostructures and tune parameters like twist angle to explore otherwise inaccessible regions of phase space.

- **Defect and Nanostructuring Techniques:** Sometimes imperfections are a boon. The 2024 pyrolytic graphite experiment used mechanical exfoliation (the “Scotch tape” method used to isolate graphene) deliberately to introduce line defects that might catalyze superconductivity ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=The%20issue%20is%20once%20again,a)). Similarly, techniques like **ion irradiation** or **chemical etching** can create nanoscale patterns (for example, creating arrays of vacancies or interstitials) that alter electronic states. While traditionally defects are thought to suppress superconductivity (by scattering Cooper pairs), certain types of ordered defects or spatial inhomogeneities might actually *promote pairing* – for instance, by enhancing local electron interactions or by facilitating charge transfer between layers. These methods are experimental and sometimes viewed as a long shot, but they represent thinking outside the box: rather than a new compound, perhaps a new microstructure in a known material could unlock high-T<sub>c</sub>. Advanced microscopy and spectroscopy now allow researchers to visualize and tune such defects with precision. The graphite study hints that **one-dimensional conductive channels** formed by line defects could host high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=The%20team%20conducting%20research%20into,resistance%20state)). Verifying and harnessing this will require further work, but defect engineering is now firmly on the map as an experimental tool in superconductivity research.

- **State-of-the-Art Measurement Techniques:** Alongside material fabrication, improved measurements have helped confirm and characterize new superconductors. For example, detecting the subtle Meissner effect (expulsion of magnetic field) in micro-samples under huge pressure is now possible using sensitive SQUID magnetometers or even quantum defects in diamonds (nitrogen-vacancy centers) to sense magnetic fields ([The Pressure's On: Diamond Anvil Cells Reimagined](https://str.llnl.gov/past-issues/julyaugust-2019/pressures-diamond-anvil-cells-reimagined#:~:text=The%20Pressure%27s%20On%3A%20Diamond%20Anvil,materials%20to%20pressures%20greater)). Ultrafast optical spectroscopy is used to study how superconductivity emerges or can be transiently enhanced (as some experiments have shown by pumping certain lattice vibrations, one can momentarily increase a material’s T<sub>c</sub>). In 2014, researchers even used femtosecond IR laser pulses on a sulfur hydride system to induce a fleeting superconducting state at room temperature ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Over%20the%20last%20decade%2C%20several,g)) – a *transient* effect that hinted at what static pressure achieved later. These experimental techniques, from high-pressure synthesis to nanofabrication and advanced sensing, collectively form the **toolkit enabling recent breakthroughs**. By mastering extreme conditions and precise tuning, scientists have brought several once-hypothetical superconductors to life.

## Theoretical Advancements Shaping the Field  

Parallel to experiments, theoretical work in the past five years has greatly influenced high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity research – both by guiding experiments and by deepening our understanding of these complex systems.

**Guiding Materials Discovery:** Perhaps the most tangible theoretical contribution has been the **computational prediction of high-T<sub>c</sub> hydrides**. Modern *ab initio* methods (density functional theory combined with structure search algorithms) were used to predict that certain compositions like LaH<sub>10</sub> or YH<sub>10</sub> would be stable under pressure and have very strong electron-phonon coupling, yielding T<sub>c</sub> well above 200 K. These predictions ([Physics - Muted Response to New Claim of a Room-Temperature Superconductor](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.16.39#:~:text=Dias%E2%80%99%20material%20belongs%20to%20a,10%20times%20lower%20than%20that)) directly motivated experimentalists to squeeze those materials in a lab – leading to the record 250 K superconductivity in LaH<sub>10</sub> ([Physics - Muted Response to New Claim of a Room-Temperature Superconductor](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.16.39#:~:text=Dias%E2%80%99%20material%20belongs%20to%20a,10%20times%20lower%20than%20that)). In essence, theory pointed the way to these remarkable compounds by virtually exploring high-pressure phase diagrams. This synergy between theory and experiment is now standard in superconductivity research. Theoretical physicists (often using machine-learning-augmented searches) are scanning the periodic table for other “superhydrides” or novel frameworks that might superconduct near room temperature. For example, calculations suggest certain ternary hydrides or hydrogen-rich materials incorporating lithium or magnesium might reach Tc’s of 300–400 K (under some pressure) – providing targets for future synthesis. While not every prediction pans out, the **success of H<sub>3</sub>S and LaH<sub>10</sub>** has energized the approach of theory-led discovery.

**Understanding Unconventional Superconductors:** On the more fundamental side, a longstanding mystery has been the mechanism behind high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity in cuprates (and now nickelates). Unlike the hydrides, cuprates are **unconventional superconductors** – their pairing is not explained by the classical electron-phonon BCS theory. For decades, various models (spin fluctuations, exchange interactions, etc.) were debated. A significant theoretical milestone was reached in 2022, when an atomic-scale experiment provided strong evidence that **superexchange** – a magnetic interaction first proposed by P. W. Anderson 35 years ago – is the “glue” for electron pairing in cuprates ([High-Temperature Superconductivity Understood at Last | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/high-temperature-superconductivity-understood-at-last-20220921/#:~:text=Now%2C%20an%20experiment%20years%20in,old%20as%20the%20mystery%20itself)) ([High-Temperature Superconductivity Understood at Last | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/high-temperature-superconductivity-understood-at-last-20220921/#:~:text=glue%2C%20he%20argued%2C%20lay%20a,When%20electrons)). Researchers directly visualized how electrons form pairs in a cuprate and found it consistent with superexchange theory ([High-Temperature Superconductivity Understood at Last | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/high-temperature-superconductivity-understood-at-last-20220921/#:~:text=Now%2C%20an%20experiment%20years%20in,old%20as%20the%20mystery%20itself)) ([High-Temperature Superconductivity Understood at Last | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/high-temperature-superconductivity-understood-at-last-20220921/#:~:text=condensed%20matter%20physics%2C%20put%20forth,When%20electrons)). This essentially confirmed that the Coulomb repulsion and antiferromagnetic interactions in the copper-oxygen planes (rather than lattice vibrations) create the high-T<sub>c</sub> superconducting state. **Theoretical advancements** like this not only settle fundamental questions but also guide us in searching for new materials – for instance, if superexchange is key, perhaps other compounds with similar magnetic exchange networks (like the nickelates or other transition-metal oxides) can be tuned to higher T<sub>c</sub> ([High-Temperature Superconductivity Understood at Last | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/high-temperature-superconductivity-understood-at-last-20220921/#:~:text=The%20new%20measurement%20matches%20a,physicist%20at%20the%20University%20of)). Indeed, the discovery of 80 K superconductivity in a bilayer nickelate under pressure may be viewed as a success for this theoretical framework, since nickelates are analogues of cuprates where superexchange and hopping parameters can be compared.

Another noteworthy development is in **computational many-body physics**. In 2024, scientists achieved a breakthrough by successfully simulating the essential physics of cuprate superconductivity using the two-dimensional Hubbard model on supercomputers ([Quantum Breakthrough Sheds Light on Perplexing High-Temperature Superconductors](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2024/05/09/quantum-breakthrough-sheds-light-on-perplexing-high-temperature-superconductors/#:~:text=In%20the%20new%20paper%2C%20Zhang,at%20the%20University%20of%20Munich)). For years, the Hubbard model (a simple model capturing electrons on a lattice with repulsive interactions) has been a testbed for understanding high-T<sub>c</sub>, but solving it exactly in regimes relevant to cuprates is extremely challenging. The recent work added next-neighbor hopping terms and performed large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, reproducing key features of the cuprates’ phase diagram and pairing behavior ([Quantum Breakthrough Sheds Light on Perplexing High-Temperature Superconductors](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2024/05/09/quantum-breakthrough-sheds-light-on-perplexing-high-temperature-superconductors/#:~:text=In%20the%20new%20paper%2C%20Zhang,at%20the%20University%20of%20Munich)). This progress in solving simplified models **validates theoretical approaches** and gives insights into what drives superconductivity. It helps answer why the cuprates superconduct at such “high” temperatures relative to other materials ([Quantum Breakthrough Sheds Light on Perplexing High-Temperature Superconductors](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2024/05/09/quantum-breakthrough-sheds-light-on-perplexing-high-temperature-superconductors/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThere%20was%20tremendous%20excitement%20when,%E2%80%9D)). Improved algorithms and computational power are allowing us to tackle problems that were intractable a decade ago – bringing us closer to a first-principles understanding of high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity.

Additionally, theorists have been exploring new pairing mechanisms and novel superconducting states. For example, proposals of **topological superconductivity** and **spin-triplet pairing** in certain systems might lead to superconductors with unique properties (useful for quantum computing). While not directly raising T<sub>c</sub>, these ideas influence how we search for materials (e.g. looking at heavy-fermion systems or ferromagnetic superconductors). In the realm of hydrides, theory has confirmed that these are largely **BCS/Eliashberg** superconductors – essentially “conventional” in mechanism despite their extreme T<sub>c</sub>. This is encouraging because it means well-understood physics can produce high T<sub>c</sub>, but it also raises theoretical questions: is there an upper limit to Tc within BCS theory? Some researchers argue we might be approaching that limit, while others point out that metallic hydrogen (if ever made metastable) could superconduct even above room temperature. Theoretical work is also guiding how to lower the pressure requirement for hydrides – for instance, by predicting which chemical substitutions or structures might retain high-T<sub>c</sub> at ambient pressure.

In summary, **theory has both illuminated and driven the field**: it has demystified the origin of high-T<sub>c</sub> in known materials (cuprates), and paved the way to new materials (hydrides) through predictive modeling. As we refine theoretical models and computational tools, we can better distinguish promising ideas from blind alleys, focusing experimental efforts where success is likely.

## Promising Directions vs. Dead Ends  

Not every bold idea in superconductivity bears fruit. The past five years have witnessed tremendous excitement but also cautionary tales. Here we differentiate the **most promising research directions** from those that have proven to be dead ends or disappointments:

- **Hydrides and “Chemical Pressure” – *Promising (with caveats)*:** The approach of combining hydrogen with other elements under pressure has indisputably yielded record-breaking T<sub>c</sub>’s. This is a promising *scientific* direction to continue – numerous hydrogen-rich compounds remain to be explored, and refinements (like ternary hydrides) could inch closer to ambient conditions. The **caveat** is practicality: superconductors that require megabar pressures are not useful outside the lab. Thus, while hydrides prove high-T<sub>c</sub> is achievable, the real prize is finding ones that work at low or no pressure. Efforts to **decrease the pressure** requirement (such as adding chemical dopants to pre-compress the lattice) are ongoing. The N-doped lutetium hydride was conceptually along these lines – achieving near-ambient pressure operation – which is why it generated so much buzz ([Physics - Muted Response to New Claim of a Room-Temperature Superconductor](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.16.39#:~:text=hydride%20that%20superconducts%20up%20to,10%20times%20lower%20than%20that)). Although that specific result was likely a dead end (retracted due to irreproducibility) ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=they%20dubbed%20LK,doped%20lutetium%20hydride%20material.l)), it does not invalidate the strategy. It simply underscores that extraordinary claims require rigorous proof. In short, hydrogen-based superconductors remain a top prospect for reaching true room-temperature superconductivity, but the key will be discovering a *stable* compound or metastable material that retains superconductivity outside of a diamond anvil cell.

- **Nickelates and Expanded Cuprate Analogues – *Promising*:** The discovery of nickelate superconductors offers a new family related to the venerable cuprates. This is promising because it provides a testbed to possibly surpass cuprates’ limits by chemical variation. For instance, could layering or doping nickelates achieve a higher T<sub>c</sub> than cuprates? The bilayer La<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> already hit 80 K ([Signatures of superconductivity near 80 K in a nickelate under high pressure - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37437603/#:~:text=Although%20high,Formula%3A%20see%20text%5D%20and)), and theoretical calculations suggest certain nickelate variants (or mixed nickel–copper oxides) might go higher. Moreover, demonstrating nickelate superconductivity at ambient pressure via thin-film strain is a significant step ([Promising new class of high-temperature superconductors achieves stability at room pressure](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-class-high-temperature-superconductors-stability.html#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Stanford%20and%20SLAC,structure%20to%20adjust%20during%20growth)) – it transforms nickelates from a high-pressure novelty to something we can study extensively. This direction seems *far from a dead end*; rather, it’s an unfolding story. We should temper expectations: so far, nickelates have not exceeded cuprates in performance and might face similar obstacles (like materials synthesis challenges and sensitivity to disorder). But they expand the landscape of high-T<sub>c</sub> materials and could reveal new physics. The same goes for other cuprate analogues (e.g. some theorize platinum oxides or other 3d/4d metal oxides could be designed). This avenue is very much alive and worth pursuing.

- **Interface Engineering and Low-Dimensional Systems – *Promising but Long-Term*:** Approaches like **twisting layers** or creating superlattices of different materials are at the cutting edge of materials science. They have yielded fascinating phenomena (e.g. the superconducting diode effect in twisted BSCCO ([Researchers Craft New Way to Make High-Temperature Superconductors – With a Twist | Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/news/researchers-craft-new-way-make-high-temperature-superconductors-twist#:~:text=team%20at%20Harvard%20University%20led,professor%20and%20physicist%20Philip%20Kim)), or magic-angle graphene superconductors). While these don’t yet give us higher T<sub>c</sub>, they offer control over pairing interactions in ways not possible in bulk crystals. One could envision designing a heterostructure where, say, a high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductor is coupled to a layer that boosts its pairing or stability. This is somewhat speculative, but it’s a *promising research direction* for discovering new states of matter. It’s not likely a quick path to room-temperature superconductors, but it enriches our toolkit and understanding. In contrast to a dead end, it’s more of a **foundational exploration** that could pay off in unexpected ways (for example, yielding superconductors with special properties even if not higher T<sub>c</sub>). As nanofabrication improves, these experiments will become more routine.

- **Graphite Defect Claims and Similar “Wildcard” Ideas – *Uncertain*:** The 2024 graphite claim is intriguing because it suggests high-T<sub>c</sub> could be achieved in a plain material (carbon) by engineering defects. If it turns out to be reproducible, it opens a whole new direction: deliberately designing defect structures to induce superconductivity. Right now, however, it remains *uncorroborated*. It’s neither clearly promising nor clearly a dead end – just highly speculative. History has seen many such surprising claims (e.g. reports of room-temperature superconductivity in amorphous composites or wet chemistry samples) that later fizzled out. A few years ago, a much-publicized claim of superconductivity at ambient conditions in a gold-silver nanostructure also turned out to be a false alarm. **Caution** is warranted with any single-team discovery that breaks known records without clear theoretical backing. The graphite result needs independent verification. Until then, it’s an interesting idea to keep an eye on, but not a proven direction. The same goes for other exotic proposals like superconductivity via biological molecules or other highly imaginative concepts – exciting if true, but requiring much scrutiny.

- **False Starts and Reproducibility Issues – *Dead Ends to Avoid*:** Unfortunately, the quest for room-temperature superconductivity has seen **several high-profile missteps**. A notable example is the case of **LK-99**, a copper-doped lead apatite that a team from Korea claimed (in mid-2023) to be a superconductor at ambient pressure and temperature. The report went viral, but within weeks it became clear that the material was not superconducting – follow-up tests showed no zero-resistance or diamagnetic transition (its observed levitation was due to ferromagnetism) ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=2023%2C%20for%20example%2C%20a%20team,doped%20lutetium%20hydride%20material.l)). The episode illustrates how *experimental error or artifact* (in this case, likely impurities causing magnetism) can be misinterpreted as superconductivity. It was essentially a dead end, and the scientific community quickly moved on. Similarly, the repeated retractions of Dias *et al.*’s papers ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=they%20dubbed%20LK,doped%20lutetium%20hydride%20material.l)) have underscored the importance of transparency and replication. As Elie Track of HYPRES Inc. lamented, the field has seen “carelessness and sloppy science” in the rush for breakthroughs ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20haven%E2%80%99t%20reached%20a%20point,%E2%80%9D)). These false starts consume attention and resources, so the community is becoming increasingly vigilant. **Promising directions** are those backed by consistent data and preferably by multiple groups (e.g. the hydrides and nickelates), whereas **dead ends** often reveal themselves via lack of reproducibility, internal inconsistencies, or violation of fundamental principles. Going forward, combining experimental claims with thorough peer review and independent confirmation will be crucial to separate real advances from mirages.

In summary, *promising routes* include continued exploration of hydrogen-rich materials, expanding the family of unconventional superconductors (nickelates, etc.), and leveraging advanced material engineering (strain, interfaces, defects) to tweak known systems. These are underpinned by theoretical guidance and past successes. *Dead ends* to be wary of include unverified “too good to be true” claims and any approach that consistently fails the test of reproducibility. Even in promising areas, one must navigate practical limitations – for instance, hydrides need breakthroughs in pressure engineering, and cuprate-like materials might need breakthroughs in fabrication. The field is learning from mistakes and homing in on strategies most likely to yield not just high T<sub>c</sub>, but also viable superconductors.

## Industry Applications and Future Impact  

High-temperature superconductors have the potential to transform industries – but only if they can be made to operate under practical conditions. Today’s commercially used superconductors (such as Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn or MgB<sub>2</sub>, and cuprate tapes like YBCO) require cooling with liquid helium or liquid nitrogen. Despite this limitation, they already enable **critical applications**: for example, MRI machines and particle accelerators rely on superconducting magnets (operating at 4 K in helium), and superconducting cables have been tested in power grids to carry large currents with zero resistance (using cheap liquid-nitrogen cooling). The promise of a superconductor that works at or near room temperature is that it would **eliminate the need for costly cryogenics**, thus dramatically lowering the barrier to deployment in a wide range of technologies ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Room%20temperature%20superconductivity%20could%20introduce,to%20run%20datacenters%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)).

If recent breakthroughs eventually yield a *room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor*, the impact would be far-reaching ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Room%20temperature%20superconductivity%20could%20introduce,to%20run%20datacenters%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)):

- **Electric Power Infrastructure:** We could build lossless power lines and transformers, radically improving grid efficiency. Currently, about 5–10% of energy is lost as heat in transmission ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=conventional%20systems%20that%20rely%20on,zero%20energy%20loss)). Superconducting cables (with no resistance) could transmit electricity over long distances with virtually no loss ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Room%20temperature%20superconductivity%20could%20introduce,to%20run%20datacenters%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). This would save energy and enable new grid architectures. Utilities have already piloted high-T<sub>c</sub> cables in some cities (with liquid nitrogen cooling); a room-temperature version would see much wider adoption, potentially replacing copper in key parts of the grid.

- **Transportation (Maglev and Motors):** Magnetic levitation (Maglev) trains use superconducting magnets to achieve frictionless travel. Japan’s high-speed maglev, for instance, uses low-T<sub>c</sub> superconductors cooled to 4 K. A room-temperature superconductor could allow such magnets to operate without expensive cooling, making Maglev trains more feasible and cheaper to maintain ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Room%20temperature%20superconductivity%20could%20introduce,to%20run%20datacenters%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). Similarly, superconducting motors and generators – which can be far more compact and efficient than conventional ones – could be used in ships, wind turbines, and electric vehicles if cryogenics weren’t an issue. In the realm of aerospace, superconducting components could reduce weight and increase efficiency (NASA has interest in superconducting power systems for electric aircraft). All these would benefit from a high-T<sub>c</sub> solution that is plug-and-play.

- **Medical and Scientific Instruments:** MRI and NMR machines, as noted, depend on superconductors. A high-T<sub>c</sub> (especially room-temperature) magnet would revolutionize MRI by removing the need for liquid helium and quench management – making MRI systems much more accessible, especially in parts of the world where helium supply is a challenge. It could also enable **stronger magnetic fields** or new magnet geometries, improving imaging resolution. In scientific research, magnet systems like those used in fusion reactors (e.g. ITER’s magnets) or particle detectors could operate more simply and at lower cost. *Persistent current* traps (where a current loops indefinitely in a superconductor) could be used for energy storage. Overall, superconductors working at ambient conditions would dramatically enhance any technology that currently uses superconducting coils or magnets ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Room%20temperature%20superconductivity%20could%20introduce,to%20run%20datacenters%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)).

- **Electronics and Computing:** Superconductors carry current without loss and can carry very high current densities, which could translate to ultrafast, energy-efficient electronics. One example is **superconducting digital circuits** (like those based on Josephson junctions) that could potentially surpass semiconductor transistor speeds and consume far less power. Prototypes of superconducting computers exist (using low-T<sub>c</sub> junctions at 4 K). Room-temperature superconducting logic or memory would be a game-changer for the computing industry, enabling processors that operate at higher frequencies with negligible resistive heating. Additionally, superconductors can produce *quantum effects* like Josephson tunneling and flux quantization that are useful for quantum computing and sensing. If such devices could work without refrigeration, integrating them into mainstream technology (from quantum sensors to ultra-fast processors) becomes much easier. Experts suggest that superconducting circuits could advance neuromorphic and AI computing by allowing novel architectures that current CMOS electronics can’t support ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=trains%2C%20and%20new%20motors%20and,to%20run%20datacenters%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). For instance, one could imagine neuromorphic networks where superconducting loops implement neurons that communicate via pulses (flux quanta) – operating at room temperature for real-time AI with minimal energy use ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Room%20temperature%20superconductivity%20could%20introduce,to%20run%20datacenters%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)).

- **Fusion Energy and Other Emerging Areas:** High-field superconducting magnets are crucial for magnetic confinement fusion reactors. The higher the temperature a superconductor can operate at, the easier it is to achieve higher magnetic fields (because cooling and stability are better). Recent high-T<sub>c</sub> cuprate tapes (like REBCO tapes) are already enabling higher-field compact fusion designs (e.g. MIT’s SPARC project uses YBCO tapes at ~20 K to reach 20+ tesla fields). A room-temperature superconductor could further simplify fusion magnet systems, potentially accelerating the development of fusion power. Even in more speculative areas like space travel, superconductors could help (for instance, superconducting magnets for plasma propulsion or for radiation shielding in spacecraft).

It’s clear that the **potential industry applications are vast**, touching energy, transportation, healthcare, computing, and beyond ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Room%20temperature%20superconductivity%20could%20introduce,to%20run%20datacenters%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). The primary limitation remains finding a superconductor that is *practically deployable* – meaning it works in everyday environments without elaborate support infrastructure. The recent breakthroughs are pushing in that direction, but as of now, even the “high-temperature” superconductors (cuprates, BSCCO, etc.) still need cooling to at least liquid-nitrogen temperatures (77 K or –196 °C). Thus, a note of caution is warranted: **we are not there yet**. As Alan Kadin noted, a commercially viable room-temperature superconductor is likely still years away, and even after a laboratory demonstration, engineering it into a manufacturable technology is a nontrivial challenge ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20an%20extraordinarily%20complex%20equation,this%20work%20outside%20a%20lab%3F%E2%80%9D)). Materials that work in tiny high-pressure anvils or thin films may need significant development to be made in bulk, shaped into wires or magnets, and operated reliably.

Encouragingly, the steady progress over the last five years gives reason for optimism. We have gone from ~135 K (cuprates) to 203 K (H<sub>3</sub>S) to 250 K (LaH<sub>10</sub>) to claims of near 290 K (in hydrides) ([Physics - Muted Response to New Claim of a Room-Temperature Superconductor](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.16.39#:~:text=Dias%E2%80%99%20material%20belongs%20to%20a,10%20times%20lower%20than%20that)) – a dramatic rise in T<sub>c</sub>. Each new material teaches us more about the principles that enable superconductivity at higher temperatures. Even the setbacks (like false alarms) teach us which pitfalls to avoid and push the community to improve experimental rigor. Looking ahead, researchers are not only hunting for higher T<sub>c</sub>, but also focusing on **stability and scalability** – for instance, exploring medium-pressure hydrides that might be stabilized in quenchable form, or investigating robust fabrication methods for brittle high-T<sub>c</sub> ceramics.

In conclusion, the field of high-temperature superconductivity is in an exciting era of discovery. Novel materials like superhydrides and nickelates are expanding the frontier towards room-temperature operation, while innovative techniques (both experimental and theoretical) are enabling leaps that were inconceivable a decade ago. There is a clearer picture emerging of what makes a superconductor “high-T<sub>c</sub>,” which will guide the design of future materials. If a true room-temperature superconductor can be realized and engineered, the payoff would be enormous – ushering in new technologies from lossless power grids to quantum computers on every desk ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Room%20temperature%20superconductivity%20could%20introduce,to%20run%20datacenters%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said)). The breakthroughs of the last five years have brought us closer than ever, turning a once far-fetched dream into a concrete scientific target. The coming years will determine how quickly these scientific advances can translate into real-world superconducting devices that operate at (or near) room temperature, transforming industries in the process. The race continues, with optimism tempered by scientific diligence, as the superconductivity community strives to make the “holy grail” a practical reality ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=Yet%20assembling%20the%20right%20mix,of%20physics%20and%20materials%20science)) ([Room-Temperature Superconductivity Heats Up – Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/room-temperature-superconductivity-heats-up/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20an%20extraordinarily%20complex%20equation,this%20work%20outside%20a%20lab%3F%E2%80%9D)).
